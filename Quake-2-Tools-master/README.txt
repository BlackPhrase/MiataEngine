id Software releases GtkRadiant source code under GPL
=====================================================

Following last summer's release of Quake III Arena source code and tools
under the GPL license, id is now placing GtkRadiant and q3map2 under GPL
license. We are also providing in this release a number of Quake II
tools that never made it under GPL when we packaged Quake II source code.

GtkRadiant [1] is the heavily modified version of QERadiant and
Q3Radiant ( id's level editors used during Quake II and Quake III Arena
development ). It runs on Microsoft Windows platforms, GNU/Linux, MacOS
X, and supports level editing for many id technology games [2].

A tarball of the initial release is available from our ftp server [3],
and the development website [4] now holds a subversion repository with
the GPL code. We expect development on the editor to continue as usual,
and hope that many new developers will join us [5] :-)
